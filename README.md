# MelodyMaker
A Java project called "Melody Maker" that represents musical notes, octaves, accidentals, and rests using scientific pitch notation, allowing users to create and store songs from text file input with support for repeated sections.

"Melody Maker" is a Java-based project, centered around queues, designed to facilitate the creation and representation of musical compositions in a digital format. In the realm of music, compositions are constructed from a combination of notes, each having distinct lengths and pitches. The pitch of a note is denoted by a letter from A to G, with the musical scale looping back to A after reaching G. These notes can also be modified with accidentals, such as sharp (#), flat (b), or natural (â™®), to deviate from the standard key signature. Moreover, musical compositions also include silences, known as rests, to introduce pauses in the music.

To efficiently represent these musical elements, the project employs the "scientific pitch notation," a standardized system that combines a letter and a number to signify a note and its respective octave. For instance, middle C is represented as C4 in this notation. The project's primary objective is to create a Java class capable of constructing and managing songs. A song, in this context, is defined as a sequence of musical notes, potentially including repeated sections. To minimize redundancy, the system stores only a single instance of a repeated segment of notes, optimizing memory usage and ensuring efficient song representation.

In practice, musical compositions are often visualized as symbols, with note symbols positioned on lines or spaces to indicate pitch and varying symbols to convey note length. To simplify the process of creating songs, "Melody Maker" takes input from text files, enabling users to define compositions in a more human-readable format.
